# Task-1-Basic-calculator
When you run the Python script, you'll see a simple text-based interface in the console:
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

The user is prompted to enter a number (1/2/3/4) corresponding to their desired operation.
Example interaction:
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0

- If addition is chosen (1), the program sums the two input numbers and displays the result.
- If subtraction is chosen (2), it subtracts the second number from the first.
- If multiplication is chosen (3), it multiplies both numbers.
- If division is chosen (4), it divides the first number by the second (handling division by zero).
If the user enters an invalid choice (like 5 or any non-numeric value), the program returns:
Invalid input
